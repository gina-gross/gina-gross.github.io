        For this assignment, I made an RGB LED cycle and fade through its different colors. I used a pushbutton with 
        a pull-down resistor so I could track its state, and whenever you press the button, it turns on the LED with 
        its fading pattern. When you let go of the button, the circuit turns off.

        I connected the red, green and blue pins of the LED to analog pins 11, 10, and 9 respectively. I connected them to analog pins so that I could fade them using PWM.
        I connected the LED's cathode (I believe that's right) to ground through a resistor; I chose 220立 because it is a good and convenient resistance level that will work
        for all colors of the LED.
                </p><p>
        The pushbutton is connected to digital pin 2 as input so I can read the button state. I followed guidance from
        the example code StateChangeDetection as well as <a href="https://create.arduino.cc/projecthub/muhammad-aqib/arduino-button-tutorial-using-arduino-digitalread-function-08adb5">this Arduino button tutorial</a> 
        by Muhammad Aqib and connected one leg of the pushbutton through a 10k立 <b>pull-down resistor</b> to ground, and the other to the 5 volt supply. I would explain more in-depth my reasoning and choice behind
        this resistor, however unlike the resistor for the LED I did not calculate for it or factor it in myself. Rather, the pull-down resistor is just a common implement to ensure state detection in a circuit; I 
        used 10k立 because it's what was used in both of the examples I mentioned, both of which covered what I wanted to do for my circuit. I don't know if 10k立 is just the standard/a common resistance to use for
        pull-downs in general, or if there is a reason in particular that it was used for these examples. Either way, I implemented it into my circuit and it worked great.

        Here is my second time with schematics. I think I did it right this time, fingers crossed!
