        For this assignment, I made four LEDs blink in a "rainbow" pattern (Red, Yellow, Green, Blue). This page hosts
        the documentation, including the circuit schematic, an image of the circuit, my code for the assignment, and
        an animated gif showing the operation of the circuit.

        I used 220Ω resistors for each LED connected to my breadboard. I chose these resistors based off of the
        following calculations: We're working with 5 volts, and the lowest voltage drop for these LEDs is 1.8, so
        5 - 1.8 = V = 3.2. The standard LED current we're working with is 20 mA, or 0.02 amps. To find the resistance
        I calculated V ÷ I, or 3.2 ÷ 0.02, which results in 160Ω. Therefore, R = 160Ω. I used 220Ω resistors for ease.

        This was my first time drawing schematics, so I'm unsure if I did it correctly. Nevertheless, I tried to show
        all of the LEDs connected to their respective digital pins, modulated by their resistors, and all being
        connected via breadboard to the single ground pin.
